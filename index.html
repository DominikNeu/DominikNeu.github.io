            <p>
                Considering cooking, the most important thing is how food tastes.
                There is a huge amount of different condiment for your meal, but which flavor
                goes with the ingredient you use for the meal.If you want to know more about
                condiment and how you produce your own herbs, click <a href="content/buildinglot.html" class="linksinttext">here</a>.

                If you are excited about small and fluffy rabbits, you will probably want to know more

                So let me tell you two things you definitely love: the beauty of nature and (what else) cakes. Am
                I right? So... why shouldn't we combine these two phenomenon into a rain-bow-cake? So I decided
                the other day to make the dream happen. If you want to know what a colorful cake is made of, check it

                Humanity always looked up to the night sky. The former sailors used to stars to navigate the open sea and
                up to now physic can not quite explain all nature mysteries that are going on out there. Most of these
                <a href="media/moon2.jpg" target="_blank" class="imglink"><img alt="Image of a full moon" src="media/moon2.jpg" class="imgleft"/></a>
                things are so far away but also nearer than we think and even more secrets can't be even seen but what
                we can see is the satellite of our earth - the moon. It's wonderful, fantastical and phenomenal and I
                always stare at it like a little child.

            <p>
                <a class="linksinttext" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira" target="_blank">Madeira</a> is a beautiful island
                in the atlantic ocean and belongs to Portugal. Its capital is Funchal with
                a population of about 112 thousand inhabitants and I'm pretty sure you know at least one of them:

                But there is so much more that Madeira can show-off with. The nature on the island
                is unbelievable beautiful and there are so many special but often hidden places you have to see if
                you have the chance to make a trip to Madeira.<br>If you want to follow me on our trip across the

                A good friend of mine made this website about his dog. Coco is a retro pug, that means he's like the
                original pug before they were so over-reared. Make sure you check out his page.

            <p>
                Who doesn't want to go for a drink with their best friend? I think everybody is with me in that concern
                and especially in the past few years, the desire for good drinks had gone up enormously. But there is so
                much you need to take into account considering mixing the perfect drink. There are like a tone of
                different ingredients you can do in your cocktail. To check what condiment goes with your drink, make
                sure you read my article <a href="content/buildinglot.html" class="linksinttext">here</a>.

            <h2 class="h2right">... a method to prevent people with epilepsy from death of SUDEP?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The other day I listened to this podcast about a AI that can prevent people with epilepsy from
                dieing of <a class="linksinttext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unexpected_death_in_epilepsy" target="_blank">SUDEP</a>.
                The AI researcher Rosalind Picard is talking about how she and here team managed to develop an AI
                that can detect seizures - the technical components are only (in) a wristband. You will definitely ask
                what is SUDEP. Well you know I'am no expert but overall, SUDEP can happen after a seizure and occurs in
                the way, that the persons breathing stops. If the person is not stimulated in that period of time also
                the heart stops. <br> If you want further information about that, as i find, very interesting topic
                make sure you check out the website I linked you <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/early-death-and-sudep/sudep" target="_blank" class="linksinttext">here</a>
                or if you are more interested in the technical side, you can just listen to the podcast below.

            <p>
                The largest Balearic Island, belonging to Spain, is mostly known as a party heaven. But apart from this,
                there are plenty of beautiful places that are hardly known. Palma, the capital of
                <a class="linksinttext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca">Majorca</a>, is very
                beautiful but more than that I enjoyed our road-trip through the highlands in the North. Follow me and
                get to know Majorca from another perspective. Click <a href="content/buildinglot.html" class="linksinttext">here</a>.

            <h2 class="h2right">... Java?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                About half a year ago, in october, I started to learn the programming language Java. First I thought
                it is going to be very difficult, but lesson after lesson I got better. If you understand the main
                functionality once, it's not that difficult anymore to program an application by yourself. Click
                <a href="content/buildinglot.html" class="linksinttext">here</a> if you want to follow my path at
                learning Java.
